# SOS-Game

## Introduction
ðŸ”¥ This project was introduced by the Algorithmik Institute of TU Braunschweig (Softwareentwicklung 2025).

ðŸ’  The goal of the game is to find the optimal solution for building rescue stations, ensuring that the budget remains minimal while guaranteeing that citizens can reach a rescue station.

## Setup Git with Godot

### Clone the repo

- If you already cloned, try `git pull`, if there are some errors, install vpn and try again.
- Open terminal:

```sh
git clone git@git.rz.tu-bs.de:isf/sep/sep2025/ibr_alg_g1/code.git
```

## Setup Server

Make sure that you installed Python (if not, go to python.org and install it). Check by:

```sh
python --version
pip --version
```

### 1. Install dependencies for server

```sh
cd backend/
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Start the development server

```sh
# root of the repo
cd code/
PYTHONPATH=. uvicorn backend.api:app --reload

# or on Linus/MacOs
cd backend/
fastapi dev
```

- The server is running at: [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)
- POST requests should be sent to: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/solve](http://127.0.0.1:8000/solve)

### 3. Get solution on Godot by sending request to server

In `/sos-game/scripts/UsageExample.gd`, you will see an example of how to create an instance and how to get the solution from your created instance.

```python
extends Node

func _ready():
# Create an instance with custom-type Instance
    var i: Instance = Instance.new()
    i.n = 3
    i.costs = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    i.coverage = [[0], [1], [2], [0, 1, 2]]

# Get solution
    var solution: Solution = await Resquest.get_solution(self, i)
    ...
```

<i>Remember that, every time you want to call the solution on Godot (client), you need to start the server!</i>

(It is like if you want to get food from your sleeping mom, you need to awake her first)

## How to export the game

### MacOS

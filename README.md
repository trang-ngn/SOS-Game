## Setup Git with Godot
### Clone the repo
- If you already cloned, try `git pull`, if there are some errors, install vpn and try again.
- Open terminal:
```sh
git clone git@git.rz.tu-bs.de:isf/sep/sep2025/ibr_alg_g1/code.git
```

## Setup Server

Make sure that you installed Python (if not, go to python.org and install it). Check by:
```sh
python --version 
pip --version
```

### 1. Install dependencies for server
```sh
cd backend/
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Start the development server
```sh
# root of the repo
cd code/ 
PYTHONPATH=. uvicorn backend.api:app --reload

# or on Linus/MacOs
cd backend/
fastapi dev
```

- The server is running at: [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)
- POST requests should be sent to: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/solve](http://127.0.0.1:8000/solve)

### 3. Get solution on Godot by sending request to server

In `/sos-game/scripts/UsageExample.gd`, you will see an example of how to create an instance and how to get the solution from your created instance. 

```python
extends Node

func _ready():
	# Create an instance with custom-type Instance
	var i: Instance = Instance.new()
	i.n = 3
	i.costs = [1, 2, 3, 4]
	i.coverage = [[0], [1], [2], [0, 1, 2]]
	
	# Get solution
	var solution: Solution = await Resquest.get_solution(self, i) 
	...
```

<i>Remember that, every time you want to call the solution on Godot (client), you need to start the server!</i>

(It is like if you want to get food from your sleeping mom, you need to awake her first)
